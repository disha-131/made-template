# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Book Recommendation System

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How accurately does the recommendation system predict user preferences and satisfaction with recommended books?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->   
The objective of this project is developing a book recommendation system. The aim behind this is the desire to connect readers with books that truly resonate with their unique tastes and preferences. In this era with an ever exapanding array of reading options, it is very difficult for people to explore the books that they genuinely enjoy. 

To address this challange, I am attempting to create a book recommendation system where, I gather the information about books title, author, publisher, etc. This data is then processed using two approaches such as collaborative filtering where, user likes the books which is similar to other users. And the other approach is content based approach which tries to guess the feature or behavior of a user given the item features.

## Datasources
